# Overview
This is a home-based project. Here, I have simulated a simple SYN flood DOS (Denial of Service) attack and analysed it using Wireshark. The main purpose of this project is to learn how DOS attack works and to gain familiarity with Wireshark. I have created two virtual machines in Oracle VirtualBox. Ubuntu is the attacker’s machine and Kali Linux is the victim’s machine. Network packets are captured in the victim’s device with Wireshark.
